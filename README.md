# Stock Market Data Analysis (1962-2021)

## Project Overview

This project focused on the statistical and econometric analysis of stock market data.
The goal is to examine return behavior, volatility patters, and relationships between trading activity and price dynamics.

## Dataset

SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset

- Historical stock data (OHLCV)
- All NASDAQ tickers
- Time period: 1962-2021

---

## Data Cleaning

The dataset wa preprocessed to ensure data quality

### Date
- Standardized date column

### Missing Values
- Removed 649 rows with missing values

### Duplicates
- All duplicate rows were removed

### Logical Consistency Check
- Removed 1264 invalid rows where:
  - High < Low
  - High < Close
  - Low > Close
  - Volume < 0

### Invalid Prices
- A significant number of records (~1 mln) had invalid Open prices equal to zero.
- It has been treated as missing values and removed to ensure data integrity.

## Feature Engineering

The following variables were calculated:

- Returns 
- Log Returns
- Volatility in 10 days periods
- Moving Averages (SMA 10, SMA 50)
- Momentum (10-day return)
- Volume change
- Target (variable was defined as the next-day return to support predictive modeling)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Two levels of analysis were defined: market level and stock level.

## Market Level

### Records Distribution
- Distribution is strongly left-skewed.
- A large proportion of stocks have observations covering nearly the entire time period.
- However, some stocks have significantly fewer data points due to later listing dates.

### Returns Distribution
- Returns are strongly centered around zero, indicating that most daily price changes are small.
- The distribution resembles a normal distribution in shape but shows heavier tails, meaning extreme values occur more frequently than expected under a normal distribution.
- The distribution appears approximately symmetric.

### Volatility Distribution
- Volatility is strongly right-skewed.
- Most observations correspond to low-volatility periods, while a smaller number of observations represent higher volatility levels.

### Correlation Structure
- Stocks exhibit moderate positive correlation (around 0.3 on average).
- However, correlations are far from perfect, suggesting that diversification is possible.

## Stock Level

### Price Behavior
- Most stocks exhibit long-term trends combined with short-term fluctuations.
- While many stocks show upward trends, some display significant declines or unstable behavior.

### Returns Behavior
- Returns fluctuate around zero and appear largely random across different stocks.

### Volatility Behavior
- Some evidence of volatility clustering is observed, where periods of higher volatility tend to persist.

### Moving Average (SMA)
- The moving average closely follows the price, smoothing short-term noise without altering the overall trend.

### Autocorrelation (ACF)
- Autocorrelation is generally close to zero, with only small deviations at a few lags.
- This suggests weak predictability of returns.

## Data Structure
- Most stocks have a large number of observations close to the maximum available.
- However, some stocks have significantly fewer data points due to later listing dates.
- To ensure data reliability, stocks with fewer than 500 observations were removed.
